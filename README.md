# Wordpress Interview Task

Task Description:

1. Create a Wordpress plugin which adds a new custom post type called "movies"

2. Each movie will have one custom field: "rating"

3. Each movie will have a "noindex nofollow" tag on its head

4. On the frontend page of each movie post, there will be 5 empty stars at the bottom. A user will be able to give the movie a rating by marking how many stars he would like (the stars will be filled with yellow). The rating will be set using an ajax request, no page refresh will happen when saving the value to the Database. 
* There is no need for a complicated rating system. 
* One rating per movie is enough. After it has been set once, you can't set the rating again.
* Donâ€™t worry about design.
